### Overview
Reconnaissance is a critical phase in network security and penetration testing, where attackers or security professionals gather information about a target to identify potential vulnerabilities. This post covers passive and active reconnaissance techniques, including tools, commands, and methodologies to collect data such as IP addresses, DNS information, subdomains, web technologies, and more.

## Passive Reconnaissance
Passive reconnaissance involves gathering information **without** directly interacting with the target, reducing the risk of detection. The goal is to collect data like IP addresses, DNS records, directories, names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses, web technologies, and subdomains.

#### What are we looking for?

- IP addresses & DNS information

- Directories & file locations

- Names, email addresses, phone numbers, physical addresses

- Web technologies & infrastructure

- Subdomains & associated services

#### Website Recon & Footprinting

- **Resolve Domain to IP:** Retrieves the IP address associated with a domain.

```shell
host <url>
nslookup <url>
```


- **Identify Web Technologies:** Determines the technologies (e.g., CMS, frameworks, servers) used by a website. Tools like Wappalyzer and BuiltWith (browser extensions) can assist, or use command-line tools.

```shell
whatweb <url>             # Standard scan
whatweb -a 1 <url>       # Stealthy mode
whatweb -a 3 <url>       # Aggressive mode
webtech -u <url>         # Alternative tool
```

- **Check Robots.txt:** Retrieves the robots.txt file, which may reveal restricted directories or sensitive paths.

```shell
curl http://<url>/robots.txt
```

- **Check Sitemap:** Retrieves the sitemap.xml file, which lists accessible pages and resources.

```shell
curl http://<url>/sitemap.xml
```

- **WHOIS Lookup:** Provides domain registration details, such as owner, registrar, and contact information.

```shell
whois <url> -h <ip>
```

- **DNS Reconnaissance:** Collects DNS-related information, such as A, MX, NS, and TXT records.

```shell
dnsrecon -d <url>
```

- **Subdomain Enumeration:** Identifies subdomains associated with a target domain.

```shell
sublist3r -d <url>        # Fast subdomain enumeration
amass enum -d <url>       # In-depth attack surface mapping
dnscan <url>              # Python-based subdomain scanner
```

- **Firewall Detection:** Identifies if a web application firewall (WAF) is protecting the target.

```shell
wafw00f <url> -a
```

#### Website technology fingerprinting

- [Wappalyzer](https://www.wappalyzer.com/apps/) (Browser extension)

- [BuiltWith](https://builtwith.com/) (Browser extension & website)

#### What is that site running?

- [Netcraft Internet Data Mining](https://www.netcraft.com/solutions/other-solutions/internet-data-research)

- [Site Report by Netcraft](https://sitereport.netcraft.com/)

#### Google Dorks (Google Hacking)
Google can be used to discover hidden resources, files, and sensitive data.

```
intitle:admin                   # Admin pages
site:example.com inurl:admin    # Admin pages in example.com
site:*.example.com              # Find subdomains
filetype:pdf                    # Search for PDFs
inurl:uploads                   # Look for uploads directories
intitle:"index of" htpassword   # Search for index listing
```

#### Finding older versions of a website

- [Wayback Machine](https://archive.org)

#### Google Hacking Database (GHDB)

- [Exploit-DB GHDB](https://www.exploit-db.com/google-hacking-database)

#### Leaked Password Databases

- [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/) - Check if an email has been compromised.

## Active Reconnaissance
Active reconnaissance involves directly interacting with the target to gather more detailed information.

#### DNS Zone Transfers

If misconfigured, a DNS zone transfer can reveal an entire list of hostnames in a domain. Example:

```shell
dig axfr <domain.com>
```

#### DNS Interrogation

Enumerating DNS records to gain more details about the domain, often revealing hidden services or subdomains.
