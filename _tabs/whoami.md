Hey there, I’m [Cyb3rtr0n](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mostafa-abdelaziz-7bb918237/)!

Penetration Tester and Aspiring Red Teamer. Passionate about uncovering and securing vulnerabilities.

I enjoy learning by doing — participating in CTFs, experimenting with tools, and exploring how systems work. Curiosity drives me, and my goal is always to make digital assets safer.

If you want to connect or collaborate on a project — you can find me on [Discord](https://discord.com/users/730897307658354869).
